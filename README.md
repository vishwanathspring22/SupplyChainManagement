# Supply Chain Management Case Study of Tesco PLC
Tesco PLC Supply Chain Management Case Study

The coursework delves into the supply chain disruptions faced by Tesco PLC and offers recommendations for improvement. Tesco, a prominent retail industry player globally, encountered significant challenges despite its resilient supply chain. The analysis commences with an overview of Tesco's supply chain management, highlighting its lean management and just-in-time concepts, along with effective information flow through electronic point of sale systems.

Three major disruptions are explored. First, the "Horsemeat in beefburgers" incident of 2013 resulted in public outrage, erasing millions from Tesco's value. The company responded by apologizing, investigating the supply chain, and revising its beef sourcing policy to enhance transparency.

Second, the "Backhauling of food waste" issue compelled Tesco to collaborate with DS Smith and Whitham Mills to efficiently manage food waste. Specialized systems were implemented to transport waste for energy recovery, promoting sustainability.

Third, the "HGV Drivers Shortage" emerged due to Brexit and the COVID-19 crisis, affecting transportation. Tesco navigated this by offering incentives, importing more goods, and introducing electric vehicles for sustainability.

The recommendations section underscores areas for enhancement. Diversified sourcing from international and local suppliers can mitigate risk. To counteract the bullwhip effect, simulation models should be utilized for better order management. Sustainability measures include expanding electric vehicle fleets and minimizing plastic use, while increasing promotion of organic products. For international expansion, adapting offerings to regional consumer behaviors is crucial.

In conclusion, Tesco's supply chain resilience is evident, but continuous improvement is essential. The case study emphasizes how disruptions prompted adaptations, offering valuable lessons for future challenges. The coursework encourages local sourcing, sustainable practices, technological advancements, and strategic expansion as pathways to enhanced supply chain management.
